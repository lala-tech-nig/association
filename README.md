This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Using the provided screens

1. Copy the supplied `stitch_ropaca_home_page` folder (from your attachments/downloads) into `public/screens/` in this project.
	- After copying, the home screen should be available at `public/screens/stitch_ropaca_home_page/ropaca_home_page/code.html`.
2. Start the dev server (`npm run dev`) and open `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Use the header navigation to view each screen. Each route loads the corresponding attached HTML inside an iframe.

If you want the HTML embedded directly into React (instead of an iframe), I can inline or convert them into React components.
